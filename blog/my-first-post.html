      <p>I'm writing this short test post in part to share some advice.</p>
      <p>I've just tried going through Cloudflare for domain purchasing, and I'm now having a go with their Pages tool.</p>
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Some findings</h2>
      <p>The experience was incredibly easy and is achieveable in less than an hour.</p>
      <p>For someone with no code experience this would still be quite a viable way to set up a website.</p>
      <p>Their domain pricing is competitive ($7 including renewals for a .work site) and the Pages functionality is free.</p>
      <p>As someone who is hesitant to get consumed in the Amazon ecosystem, this is a great alternative. It's nice knowing no amount of page hits is going to cause hosting costs.</p>
